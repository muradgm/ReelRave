  "description": "ReelRave Movie Review app's frontend is a sleek and dynamic user interface, built using the latest web technologies. The application utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to deliver a smooth and responsive experience. Navigation is made easy with the help of react-router-dom, which allows for seamless transitions between pages. The app communicates with the backend using axios, a popular HTTP client library, ensuring seamless data transfer. To add a touch of style, the app uses react-icons and tailwindcss, two popular styling libraries, to create a visually appealing interface. All these technologies come together to provide an unparalleled movie review experience for users.",
